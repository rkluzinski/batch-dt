A python script for batch converting sets of points to delaunay
triangulations, stored as .obj files.
The delaunay triangulations are computed using scipy.

batch-dt attempts to read point data from every file in the './input/'
directory wherever 'batch_dt.py' is located.
It outputs all .obj files the the directory './output' relative to the
location of 'batch_dt.py'.
