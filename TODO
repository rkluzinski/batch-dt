TODO:
-write more unit tests for volume under triangle
-write tests for volume_under_surface
-compute areas after triangulations are computed
-script to benchmark scipy.spatial.Delaunay (matplotlib)
-option for logging to file in batch_dt
-write script for viewing the finished triangulations (via openGL)

Questions:
1) File I/O method?
2) Output volumes under curve to file?
